## Introduction
Ever argued with your partner about choosing what to eat for diner?
Well, I did and thats why Food Tindr was created.
Its an app that allows you to create a room just for you and your friend/loved-one.
In the room you are presented with variety of culinary propositions to choose from by "liking" or "disliking" them.
When both of you "like" the same meal you are presented with a recipe and list of ingredients required to make you dinner dream come true.
